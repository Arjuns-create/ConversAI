# ConversAI

**ConversAI** is an innovative conversational AI framework designed to empower users with intelligent interactions across various document formats and web content. Utilizing advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, ConversAI enables seamless text extraction and querying capabilities, making it an invaluable tool for researchers, students, professionals, and anyone who regularly interacts with text-based information.

## Introduction

In an era characterized by information overload, efficient data processing is crucial. ConversAI addresses this challenge by leveraging state-of-the-art technologies to transform unstructured data into actionable insights. Whether extracting meaningful information from PDFs, fetching transcripts from YouTube videos, or gathering data from multiple web pages, ConversAI provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies these complex tasks.

### Key Technologies Used:
- **Gradio**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **Langchain**: For chaining various data retrieval and processing tasks.
- **EasyOCR**: For optical character recognition in scannable PDFs.
- **Pymupdf**: For handling searchable PDF documents.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping and HTML parsing.

With its modular design, ConversAI is not just a tool but a platform that can be extended and customized to fit diverse user requirements.

## Features

- **Text Extraction**: Extracts text from both searchable and scannable PDFs.
- **Web Crawler**: Gathers and processes text from websites efficiently.
- **YouTube Transcript Retrieval**: Fetches and processes video transcripts for easy querying.
- **Conversational Interface**: Interactive Gradio UI for seamless user interaction.
- **Configurable**: Easily customizable to fit specific use cases.
- **Advanced Document Retrieval**: Utilizes sophisticated algorithms for improved accuracy and relevance.

## Benefits

- **Time-Saving**: Automates text extraction, allowing users to focus on analysis rather than manual data entry.
- **Accuracy**: High-precision text extraction capabilities ensure that users receive reliable data.
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive interface makes it accessible for users with varying technical skills.
- **Scalable**: Modular architecture allows for easy integration of additional features and functionalities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running ConversAI, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
apt-get install poppler-utils -y
```

Additionally, you need to set up your environment variables for the GROQ API:

1. Sign up on [Groq](https://www.groq.com) and obtain your API key.
2. Set the `GROQ_API_KEY` in your environment variables.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ConversAI.git
   cd ConversAI
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

To launch the application, run the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

The Gradio interface will open in your default web browser.

### Important Configuration Note

In case a GPU is unavailable, please modify the `config.ini` file as follows:

- Under the `[EMBEDDINGS]` section, change:
  ```ini
  device = cuda
  ```
  to:
  ```ini
  device = cpu
  ```

- Under the `[EASYOCR]` section, change:
  ```ini
  gpu = true
  ```
  to:
  ```ini
  gpu = false
  ```

These adjustments will ensure that the application runs smoothly on CPU resources.

### Important Note

After using the interface, be sure to click the "Clear" button to reset the fields. This is crucial because session management has not been implemented in this version, and failing to clear inputs may lead to unintended data persistence during subsequent interactions.

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed while working as an AI Engineer at [Tech Consulting Partners](https://www.techconsultingpartners.com). I built ConversAI from scratch, implementing advanced document retrieval methods, reranking techniques, hybrid search methodologies, multiple integrations with large language models (LLMs), and lots of other complex functionalities. 

The backend includes user management features, sophisticated data storage solutions (including S3 storage management), database management, and vector databases. The deployment strategy leverages robust APIs, Docker containers, CI/CD practices, model monitoring, and cloud platform deployment. 

This open-source prototype serves as a stepping stone towards a more comprehensive project aimed at public good, showcasing the immense potential of advanced AI technologies in everyday applications. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Tech Consulting Partners for entrusting me with this initiative and for their invaluable support throughout the development process.
